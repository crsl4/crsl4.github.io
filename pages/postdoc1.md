Postdoc: Wisconsin Institute for Discovery

Subject: Postdoc at Wisconsin Institute for Discovery

- What: Postdoctoral position in the intersection of genomics, data science, computational biology, statistics
- Where: Wisconsin Institute for Discovery at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (https://wid.wisc.edu/)
- PI: Claudia Solis-Lemus' research involves the development of statistical models to answer biological questions, balancing biological interpretability, theoretical guarantees, and computational tractability. More details here: http://crsl4.github.io/pages/news.html
- Research project: Open to discussion! Several opportunities in ongoing projects: phylogenetic networks, bayesian phylogenetic inference, high-dimensional highly-correlated regression models applied to genomic/biological data, neural networks/deep learning models to predict phenotypes like antibiotic-resistance, among others. Note: If you are more on the empirical side than the computational side, and would like to work with me, email me and we can include other faculty as co-advisor

- Graduate students and postdoc positions at Wisconsin Institute for Discovery at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (https://wid.wisc.edu/)
- Multi-disciplinary environment
- Possible programs for grad students: PhD in Plant Pathology, PhD in Statistics, PhD in Mathematics, PhD in CS (application deadlines in December)
- Research project for postdocs: Open to discussion! Several opportunities in ongoing projects: phylogenetic networks, bayesian phylogenetic inference, high-dimensional highly-correlated regression models applied to genomic/biological data, neural networks/deep learning models to predict phenotypes like antibiotic-resistance. Empirical/biological research projects welcome too.
