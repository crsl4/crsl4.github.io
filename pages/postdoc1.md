Subject: Postdoc at Wisconsin Institute for Discovery

- What: Postdoctoral position in the intersection of genomics, data science, computational biology, statistics
- Where: Wisconsin Institute for Discovery at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (https://wid.wisc.edu/)
- PI: Claudia Solis-Lemus. Research involves the development of statistical models to answer biological questions, balancing biological interpretability, theoretical guarantees, and computational tractability. More details here: http://crsl4.github.io/
- Research project: Open to discussion! Several opportunities in ongoing projects: phylogenetic networks, bayesian phylogenetic inference, high-dimensional highly-correlated regression models applied to genomic/biological data, neural networks/deep learning models to predict phenotyoes like antibiotic-resistance, among others.
