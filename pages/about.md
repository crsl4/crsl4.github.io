description: Claudia Sol&iacute;s-Lemus is postdoc at University of Wisconsin - Madison working with Bret Larget on Bayesian phylogenetics
---

I am an assistant professor at the [Wisconsin Institute for Discovery](https://wid.wisc.edu/) and the [Department of Plant Pathology](https://plantpath.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu).

Before, I was a postdoc at the [Department of Human
Genetics](https://genetics.emory.edu/) at [Emory
University](http://www.emory.edu) working with professor [Michael
Epstein](http://genetics.emory.edu/faculty/primary/epstein-michael.html)
on Genome-Wide Association Studies, and before that, I was a postdoc in UW-Madison working with professor [Bret
Larget](http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~larget) on statistical computing
methods for Bayesian phylogenetics.

I did my PhD in [Statistics](http://www.stat.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu)
with professor [Cécile Ané](http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~ane) in the inference of phylogenetic networks to represent the
tree of life expanded by extra hybridization edges. Understanding the evolutionary history of species is essential
to conservation efforts and to discover the tree of life.

I obtained my Master's degree in [Mathematics](http://www.math.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu)
with emphasis on probability theory.

I am originally from Mexico City where I did my Undergraduate degrees
in Actuarial Sciences and Applied Mathematics at [ITAM](https://www.itam.mx/en).

In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, running, biking and yoga!
